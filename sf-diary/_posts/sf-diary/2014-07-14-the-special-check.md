*One small step for the mankind, one huge step for me. For the first time in 26 years, I stepped on the American soil outside of an airport. Did I feel a sudden surge of freedom enter my body? Not really, but after some 24 hours here I can say that it definitely does feel different. But let's start from the beginning.*

## The Special check

I hate airport security. Not because of the fact that they Xray all your stuff, but because of the people there. Even in 2014 there are still people that are surprised they have to take off their belt when going through the frame.

After I went through the frame and got a detailed patdown and foot massage from the security guy, they asked me to open my bag and show them the contents. "We have to do a special check," the guy said after reviewing my stuff, "Please take this and follow me."

Now, think of most humiliating thing you can imagine. Got it? Cool. Now imagine that you are walking through the terminal of Tegel, with your shoes untied, carrying your stuff, and being accompanied by an airport security officer, while all the people look at you like you are some kind of criminal. Doesn't that feel more humiliating? It sure does.

I still don't know what was the reason for the special security check, but they pretty much checked all the items in my bag with this little sticky paper that they then put into the big machine for doing special security checks. Or something like that. "Alles in ordnung, you can take your stuff."

Fortunately the rest of the trip was way less eventful. Binge watching House of Cards in the plane (7 episodes!), pretty smooth transfer in Chicago (1 hour from landing to being in the other terminal including going through immigration), terrible flight to SFO (4.5 hours in the coach config of a 737-800 is _way_ too much), and then, after landing with a decent bang, *"Welcome to San Francisco, I hope you have some flower in your hair"*.

The good thing about the US is that even though you fly for 4.5 hours, you are still within one country, and so you don't have to through additional border control or customs. Since my AirBnb was just a BART (*Bay Area ~~U-Bahn~~ Rapid Transport*) ride away, after another 50 minutes I was dragging my suitcase along the 8th Street, dodging homeless people, and soon punching the key code for the apartment.

Needless to say, I was so destroyed by the whole day that after taking a shower I went to bed at circa 9PM and slept like a baby until the next day. Well, until 6am, but that's another story!
