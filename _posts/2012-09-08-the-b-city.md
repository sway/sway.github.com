I feel like a grown up now. It is not because of my thesis defense or graduation, but because of last week. Someone had actually paid real money to get me to a different city and talk to me. Yep, that's true, I had my first big interview in a company and since it was in Berlin, they covered all the travel expenses. I really felt like a celebrity, even though this is quite a common practice when it comes to later rounds of the recruitment process. And even though I did not have much time to look around Berlin, I captured some of the moments with Instagram, hipster-style!

Some people say that Berlin is the least German city in Germany. I would say that it still is a nice and organized German city, but the "melting pot" of all the different nationalities gives it a different flavor, that you can simply feel in the air. It is somehow more *lively* and *cool*. And there was a lot of pretty girls.

Another thing that seems really cool is the public transport. Train, S-Bahn, U-Bahn, trams, buses. The whole city is full of intertwining lines and tracks, and even though the office was quite close to the Hbf, there were at least 4 different ways how to get there. Amazing!

After the interview I was really exhausted. Originally I was planning to go out, get some good meal and visit at least the famous *Alexanderplatz*, but as soon as I got to the hotel, my body shut down and all I was able to do was get two *Weizenbiers* in the hotel bar. Alone.

The next morning, after an awesome breakfast in the hotel, I boarded another ICE and went back "home". Despite having spent only few hours in the city, I really liked it. It is cheap, it is international, and it is not so uptight as other Germany cities. That said, I really hope that the result of my interview will be positive. We'll see next week.
