Dear brain,

it's me, your owner and friend. First of all, let me apologize for the severe beating I gave you yesterday, but I think you understand that losing in the semifinals deserved to be flushed down with few beers and jagers.

Over the years we've done some amazing stuff together. Do you remember when you told me to take that shoulder-level outside, on the border of the strikezone, that I then slammed all the way to the right field and scored a 3B hit with bases loaded? Or when I crashed and burned with that one girl and you adviced me to apply for a grad school abroad? Or when you assured me that jumping over that ditch on my bike is safe and I crashed and f-ed up my elbow? I do, the scar is still there, but it's fine, the bike was intact.

Anyway, I am writing this letter because I need to talk to you about one issue. You know that we are now working on my thesis and that we want to graduate as soon as possible. You also know that after breaking up with J. two months back we said that we will leave all the relationship and falling in love stuff to other people, focus on the graduation, get a job, work 80 hours a week and then, when we have a nice senior position, look for a nice girl to fall in love with. Right. So why the fuck can't you do that?

We meet a nice and pretty girl and you, instead of thinking _"Oh yeah, a nice girl, but I heard your thesis is also pretty hot, so get back to work"_ you go all mental and start telling me _"Ask her out, ask her out!"_. Don't you understand that I really don't have the mental capacity to handle that right now? Can't you wait at least a month or so, and then just tell me _"Do you remember that one girl we met few weeks back? Go get her, tiger!"_. I really appreciate your care, but seriously, remember all the drama that came with the last relationship. Remember how it made us feel all bonkers. I am not implying that it would be the same again, but I think that graduation is an issue serious enough to play it safe.

So, dear brain, fuck you! Cut the shit and be nice to me for a while, I really need to get the stuff done.

Thank you, and now if you excuse me, I have to work on my presentation for tomorrow while you keep making up movie-like scenarios including __Me__, __Her__, and __happily ever after__.

Yours sincerely

Honza
