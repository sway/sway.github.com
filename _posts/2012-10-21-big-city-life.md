Few weeks back I published a post about my trip to Berlin for an interview called [The B-City](http://egoistic.biz/2012/09/08/the-b-city/) hoping there would be a sequel to it, *The B-City II*. The good news is, there is one. The bad news is, well, there is no bad news!

## The B-City II

Moving to a new city is nothing new for me. In the last three years this was the third time doing that (Delft, Seoul, and now Berlin), so I am pretty much aware of all the aspects of such change. It is exciting, it is adventurous, and it is fresh, but it might be also lonely and complicated. No friends, no family, no favorite bars and places. This becomes apparent after the initial excitement goes away one you are facing the reality, and for some people might be a big problem to overcome. After talking about this with one Swiss girl I realized there are two different ways to deal with it. Either you can succumb to it and cry yourself to sleep, or you take the words of Clark Gable and just go.

> *Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.* 

Even though I might not be as charming as Clark, I definitely tend to choose the "Gable-way". No looking behind, just seizing the opportunity to go forward. It worked out pretty much fine two years back, and I am sure it's going to work out again.

## The past

So, how the hell did I get to Berlin? After the on-site interview in September I had to go through one more Skype call with one of the co-founders of the company. This kind of held my hopes high, because it meant that I was still *"in the game"*. The next day I received one of the most amazing and greatest e-mails ever offering me a position in the company. I gave it a thought and next morning accepted the offer, because, quite frankly, you don't say "no" to a dream job. At the end of September I packed my life into a suitcase, took an ICE from Frankfurt to Berlin, and here I am.

## The present

Tomorrow I will start my fourth week in the company, and I have to say, I am still enjoying it quite a lot. I don't want to go into detail about the company or the job, because it's just not my thing to do so, so I will just say that I am one of the product guys in a medium-sized Internet startup. Go figure.

I have still not completely settled down, because I am still looking for an apartment (thanks god for a company apartment!) and figuring out stuff like bank account, mobile plan, etc. I hope to get all this stuff done by the end of the month, because only after that I will be able to say **I am a Berliner!**.

For now, just stay tuned for more exciting posts about Berlin!
