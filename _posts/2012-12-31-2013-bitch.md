I am not very good with end-of-the-year reflections. I tend to forget important things or put too much emphasis on some minor details no one cares about, so I'll just make it short.

**2012** has been a peculiar year. I graduated from college, ending the 18 year education spree (*C-C-C-combo breaker!*). I also found my very first job, moved to another city (*3rd time since 2010, this time Berlin*), and started a completely new life again. Before all that, I also broke up with my girlfriend, which definitely affected the rest of the year, and made me single for the rest of the year (hint, hint!). Life is not always awesome, you know. Apart from all these big things there has been a lot of small successes, victories, failures, and lessons learned that pushed me forward, lifted my head into the clouds, but also kept my feet on the ground. Simply the usual.

With hindsight the last few years have been amazing. Constant progress and steep learning curve, growing up and becoming an adult, new experiences, people, friends, places, etc. I really hope that 2013 will be the same, or even better, and I am really excited about all the new things I will see and experience in 2013.

One thing is for sure, however, the year will be much less dynamic when it comes to moving around the world --- I need to settle down for a bit as well. 

That said, I hope that everyone has an amazing year ahead, full of success, luck, love, and other stuff. **Work hard, play hard, don't forget to have fun, and, most importantly**:
