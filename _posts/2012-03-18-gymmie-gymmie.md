> Kids, back in 2007, it seems like everyone belonged to  these silly things called gyms. The idea was you'd pay them lots of money to run around and lift heavy things.  Biggest rip-off in the world and yet people fell for it.  Including me.

This quote from my favorite TV show really expresses the whole idea behind "gyms". Or does it?

About two weeks back I decided to stop turning into a vegetable and enroll into a nearby gym. Frankly, it is really hard to resist the advertisement, as most of them show pretty and fit girls between 25-30, smiling while working out on one of the high tech machines. Something like this.

In reality, however, you find there all the different types of people except for this girl. There are those big and muscular and tan guys, that walk around in their tight shirts, fist bumping other guys and all the trainers in the gym. Then there are those "girls", that look like guys and are probably stronger than half of the guys there. Then there are people like me, minding their own business with their iPods and generally looking pretty. This group includes both guys and girls, and it represents around 1/3 of the people there. A special group are girlfriends of the aforementioned douchebags, that wear a ton of makeup and have big boobs. Sorry, there is not much more about them. Finally, there is the last group, comprising other types of people, that are not common enough to have their own category.

For me it is my first real gym subscription, and in fact, it is just the second time that I voluntarily go to a gym regularly. So, why do I go to the gym? I don't want to look like those guys described above, but at the same time I don't want to be look like a nerd, all pale and skinny and weak. And yes, i want to get rid of my beginning beer belly.

I don't really like cardio so I mainly focus on free weights and the various machines. And man, those machines are crazy. All the gyms I have ever been to had those classical white ones, that were easy to use and you always knew what to do with them. When I came here I was like _"WTF?"_. Everything looks incredibly fancy and I think there is a machine for every single part of the human body, including that tiny muscle hidden somewhere. All the mechanisms are also incredibly complicated, and it happened to me few times that I really had to think about how to use some machine. There were simply too many levers, buttons, and adjustment knobs and I got completely confused. Shit happens, doesn't it.

Anyway, since the beginning of March I have been in the gym ca. 14 times, and I think that's pretty good. I try to keep a 5 times a week routine, with a 3-1-2-1 scheme and it seems to work out pretty well. The one day break is enough to regenerate a little, but it does not affect the overall rhythm. Since the gym is open till 10:30pm on weekdays, I don't really have to plan my days around it. And do I enjoy it? Of course I do! There is a huge mirror so I can stare at myself while lifting dead weight and sweating like a pig. I can get my arms so sore I am not able to change my t-shirt after the work out. I can watch other people do the same. And, I pay for all of that every months with a 6 months subscription. Awesome, right!

So, coming back to the first paragraph, maybe gyms are the biggest rip-off in the world, but frankly, the feeling when you feel that you are getting stronger, that your body is not turning into a rotten piece of vegetable anymore and that those two hours a day are the only time when you don't think about your work and other problems, that feeling is really priceless. And who knows, maybe after those 6 months I will look like that hot guy. Or the other one.
