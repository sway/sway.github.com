title: "Once upon a time in the West!"
---

As you probably know, after finishing my bachelor in 2010 I did not continue in the Czech Republic, but moved to Holland to do my masters at the Delft University of Technology.

Now that I am graduated I thought it would be the best time to summarize what these two years were about and why do I think it was a good idea.

## The country
Holland is quite a peculiar country. Quite small, but rich thanks to the numerous ports (and mainly the one in Rotterdam). It is really international and tolerant, but the people are quite closed and inaccessible for foreigners. Known for legalized (or tolerated) consumption of marihuana, yet only minority of Dutch people use it regularly.

I would say that my relationship to Holland developed in three phases. First phase was kind of manic --- _"Everybody speaks English"_, _"Everybody rides a bike"_, _"People are friendly"_, _"Everything is so nice"_, and so on. After some time, the manic phase turned into depression. _"The food sucks"_, _"It's always raining and windy"_, _"Dutch bureaucracy is terrible"_, _"I WANT SUN!"_, _"Why are people always so mean to me?"_.

That was the first few months. After that, the situation had stabilized, as I got used to all the good and bad aspects of living there. Yes, it is great that everybody speaks English, but at the same time it is really difficult to learn Dutch and talk to people, because as soon as they hear that you have a foreign accent, they switch to English. It is just more convenient for them. You also have to get used to people being mean to you. They say, that it's a cultural thing for them, and that they are just direct. Fine, whatever, I can deal with it, but since they say they are international and friendly, they should also think about adjusting to other cultures, not just expecting everybody to adjust to theirs. Sometimes I suspect the whole "being direct" thing is just something they made up to be able to be mean to foreigners. Who knows. And yes, both the food and the weather are terrible.

The main idea behind Dutch _cuisine_ is "Take something gross and deep fry the shit out of it". Take, for example, a krokette. Mashed meat of questionable quality, mixed with flour and covered in breadcrumbs. All of that deep frozen and ready to be deep fried. 0.90&euro;, please. The same goes for bitterballen, frikandelle, or kaas souffle. But you get used to it over time.

The same goes for the weather. The summers are usually hot, but full of rain. There are like 3 sunny days every year, and if you miss them, you are A-screwed. Ok, 3 might be a little underrated, but it is not more than 10. Or 20. The rest of the year is just grey sky, a lot of wind, and rain. And wind. And rain. And wind. Did I tell you that it is really windy and it rains a lot?

But let's be fair, Holland is a really nice country to live in. For a foreigner it might be a little difficult to integrate into the Dutch society, but I believe that things get much easier once you speak Dutch. On top of that, Dutch girls are pretty (in their own way), there is a lot of internationals, and the trains usually work quite well. And, of course, bikes. That said, if I would have to make the choice again, I would still go for Holland. Moreover, If someone would offer me a position there, I definitely would not have problems living there for a little longer. I would choose a different city than Delft.

## The program
Management of Technology, usually referred to as MoT, is a well-known discipline, which focuses on management and usage of technologies in an commercial environment aiming at gaining a competitive advantage. The core topics are therefore related to innovation management, economics, HR management, decision making and strategy, etc.

Unfortunately, such track is not offered at any Czech university, which is bad, because it perfectly combines technology with business, and allows people with an engineering background to extend their skill set beyond strictly technical areas. Such multidisciplinary knowledge can later be a a great advantage, and it shows that a person is versatile and able to handle and combine diverse topics and knowledge.

Even though I did not realize all of that before coming to Delft, I am now more than satisfied with my choice, and I would say that it had even exceeded my expectations. The two years definitely helped me explore different aspects of technology, and changed my mindset from strictly engineering to more of a business-engineering blend. I would say that I can still code and develop software, but I also realize that sometimes it is more important to deliver, than to have a *O(log n)* algorithm.

## The environment
There are two aspects to this point --- international and stimulating. Since all the masters programs in the NL are in English, they attract quite a lot of international students. Even though TU Delft, and especially my faculty, are not the most international ones in Europe, the presence of diverse cultures and nations is highly noticeable and you can see that it definitely shapes the environment.

For me, international environment became kind of like a drug. I need internationals. I need to deal with different cultures. I need the diversity. It is amazing how enriching such experience is, and how different is the vibe of the place when there are international people there.

The second aspect, stimulating environment, is something that I was not used to from my bachelor studies. I would say that Czech universities are dull. They do no give you the incentive to get involved and in many cases do not even offer an opportunity. In Delft, the possibilities are much wider. Sports, culture, start-ups, politics. Multitude of events and presentations focusing on careers, sustainability, entrepreneurship. All of that directly on the campus, which makes it accessible to everybody.

Events such as the [*Entrepreneurship forum*](http://www.yesdelft.nl/eforum) are a great addition to the curriculum, and the presentations are really inspiring. This year there were speeches by __Pieter Geelen__, the founder of TomTom, __Claire Boonstra__, the founder of Layar and a TU Delft alumnus, and __Tobias Edstr&ouml;m__, a former tennis player and an executive at Spotify. All of them gave a great presentation focusing on different aspects of starting a new company, and I especially liked Pieter's presentation, in which he described the impressive journey from a tiny company (back then start-up was not a hype word yet) to a multi-billon corporation in a funny and entertaining way.

## Extracurricular activities
Soon after coming to Holland I realized that just following the courses is not enough. Or, well, it is enough for a degree, but it certainly won't impress anyone. Since the first year is quite demanding on school work, gaining experience through a part-time job or an internship is not really feasible. This is where the extracurricular activities come handy.

The university is connected to several organizations, which offer different courses and projects to work on during the school year. For me the first one was the __Turning Technology into Business__ course, organized by _YES!Delft_, an incubator associated to the university. The course's main idea was to commercialize a patent, that was invented at the university, and write a business plan for such commercialization.

Our final idea was a lightweight aircraft cargo container made with a composite frame, that would save airliners thousands of Euro on fuel every year, hence also reduce the carbon footprint. Even though our idea placed 2nd in the finals of TTiB, we have won two of three rounds of an entrepreneurial competition, and even talked to KLM about the feasibility of the idea. Unfortunately, since most of us went abroad, we had to drop the project.

The second course was the __Design Challenge__, a semester-long project, during which several student teams worked on diverse projects initiated by 3rd party clients. This project was significantly different from TTiB, because: 

1. our project focused on the bottom of the pyramid context of East Africa; and 
2. our team sucked.

The project concerned design and business plan development of a bicycle trailer in Kenya, which is a topic completely opposite to a high-tech patents and composite structures. Dealing with developing countries is quite difficult --- there is less information about the conditions there, and all the assumptions are quite difficult to validate. At the end, detailed context research proved to be the most time consuming, and most important part of the whole project.

Our team, composed of three IO students and myself really struggled to gain some momentum over the course of the project. That meant, that on top of dealing with a rather complex subject and problem context, we also had to deal with terrible group dynamics. With hindsight, it was a useful experience and I have learned a lot about working in teams etc., but back then it was very, very frustrating.

Despite all that our team managed to win a design contest organized by our client, which gave us the opportunity to actually go to Kenya and realize the project there. I doubt such thing would be possible back in the Czech Republic.

Of course, these are not the the only projects you can participate on. Apart from more entrepreneurial courses at YES!Delft there are also several extremely exciting things such as Formula Student racing teams (conventional, electric, hydrogen), motorbike racing, solar car, solar boat, solar decathlon, etc. Whenever you feel like getting involved in something awesome, there definitely is a team looking for more people.

These extracurricular projects are a great addition to your resum&eacute;, showing that you are eager to extend your skill set and step up to a challenge they represent. On top of that, some of them can also be integrated within the study program, giving you additional ECTS to replace some of the electives, for example. I am a little sad that I did not have more time to spend on these projects, because they definitely allow you to explore new areas and topics, and solve some really intriguing problems.

## The reputation
In Europe, TU Delft is regarded as a truly prestigious university. I do not want to outclass Czech universities, but the truth is, that while Delft regularly ranks quite high in the annual QS ratings (2012: 103th in general, 18th in tech. and engineering), the first Czech university is 286th (Charles University). CTU, as the first purely technical school, ranks 500--550th.

I know that this ranking does not exactly express what it is like to study at that one particular university, but it gives a good indication about the _whole package_ offered. A higher-ranked university is more likely to offer good environment, attract interesting professors and speakers, have more resources to support student activities, and generally offer more perks and benefits. Naturally, it also looks better on your resum&eacute;, which I think still counts, especially when looking for the first position.

## Conclusion

So, here I am, two years later, with a degree in my pocket and the first job behind the corner.

Am I still the same person as I was two years ago? Yes, and no. I still do the same stuff, look the same, and still have some good and bad characteristics. On the other hand, I have learned tremendous amount of new things, got used to living alone and taking care of myself in two different foreign countries. I have grown up and calmed down, focusing on what's important and what is not. Additionally, I have a lot of new, and great friends and my personal network shifted from mostly Czech to mostly international.

So, would I do all of this again? Definitely. Coming to Delft opened my eyes and gave me a completely new outlook on the world. So many possibilities, so many exciting countries, so many projects and companies to work with, so many cultures to explore and understand. Three years ago, my life was in the Czech Republic. Now, my life is in the whole world.
