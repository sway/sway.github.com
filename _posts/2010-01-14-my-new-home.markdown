This is my new home. The virtual one. I have decided to switch from regular hosting to GitHub pages, because:

1. It's free
2. I don't need the space --- I use Dropbox and Cloud.app, which is absolutely sufficient
3. For e-mail I use Google Apps
4. I've used Posterous as my blogging platform anyway

Paying for standalone hosting is therefore useless.
