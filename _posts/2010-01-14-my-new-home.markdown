This is my new home. The virtual one, of course. It is no longer hosted on a standalone hosting, but I have decided to fully outsource all the service I use
under my domain. It's cheaper (as in free) and it fulfills all my needs.

1. Sometimes I used my hosting to store temporary rubbish (screenshots etc.), but now we have cloud storage, there is no need for that. Now I use mainly
   [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) (as for collaboration) or [cloud.app](http://cloud.ly) for temporary stuff.
2. E-mail and calendar is handled by Google Apps. And that's all...
3. For blogging (or "blogging" in my case), I have used Posterous anyway. Now the site is stored on [GitHub](http://github.com), I can use jekyll, which is a static content generator, with Markdown and Liquid support.

All these services offer free versions, that are sufficient for my needs. When I realize, that two years ago I was thinking about getting a HostMonster
account, it is a kind of a scaledown. But well, as we grow older, we need less stuff.

Anyhow, I will try to keep it running here. I know my blogs usually die after few months, but let's give this one a chance.
