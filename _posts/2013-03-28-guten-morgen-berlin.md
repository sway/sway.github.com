> Guten Morgen, Berlin,  
> Du kannst so h&auml;sslich sein, so dreckig und grau.

The most beautiful ugly city. Dirty, filthy, gray, and broken. Love or hate relationship. Just like when you are unexplicably attracted to a girl that is not so pretty, but you just cannot help it. City that partially disgusts you, but at the same time gives you a secure feeling, because you feel like it will be there for you when you need it. Outlier among German cities. Berlin.

Trying to describe and understand Berlin is almost impossible unless you already have some experience with the city, that is not just *"partying for the whole weekend in Berghain"*. My most favorite portrayal is the song **Schwarz zu Blau** from **Peter Fox**, which absolutely precisely expresses the atmosphere of the city, when it turns from black to blue, i.e. from night to dawn. Listening to this song while coming from Rosie's this Sunday morning and looking from the Warschauer Brucke, when the night just turned into a sunny morning was just priceless. One of the moments when everything just clicks together.

I will probably never be a true "Berliner". Spending six months in a city like this merely shifts you from the *"tourist"* category into the *"expat"* category, and while I merely adopted Berlin, others were born into it, molded by it. I am not sure whether I will ever be able to really become a part of the city, but one thing is for sure - while I'm here I'll do my best to make it count.

On a more general note, my "Berlin clock" is slowly approaching the 6 months mark, which is kind of a milestone for me, since my *Probezeit* in the company will be over. And so far it has been a great ride. I think I might reflect upon the first months of my first job in a separate post to avoid mixing business and pleasure, but still, I cannot keep myself from saying that I love my job and am extremely happy about my decision to come to Berlin. 'nuff said.
