__tl; dr:__ *I wrote a book. It is about Korea. It is awesome! You can get it [here][book]*.

As you surely know, I was in South Korea for about 4 months, studying at the KAIST Business School. And because I wanted everybody to know what I was doing there, I kept a blog called S(e)oul eXchange. I know, the name looks stupid, but that's not important. Contrary to my expectations, I really enjoyed writing the blog, posting pictures and showing off in general. When some people told me that it is quite nice and funny to read, I was even more motivated to keep it going for the whole 4 months. I think I kind of succeeded, even though December was a very quite month, blog-wise. _"So where is the book in this story?"_, you might be asking now. Well, one day, when I was Skyping with my sister, she said something like _"I really like your blog, you should publish it as a book"_. Normal people would laugh and let it go, but not me. In that moment my mind started thinking about all the possible ways how to do that, how long would it take and what would I have to do. After few days of thinking it through, I decided to do it, mainly as a Christmas present for my parents and friends.

I don't want to bother you with technical details (at least not now), so I will try to keep it comprehensible for a non-geek. When you want to publish some text, i.e. get it printed and binded, you could do it in two ways. First way is the easy one. Find a DTP studio, give them the texts and pictures, consult the design and layout and let them do the magic. The second, and more difficult way, is DIY, do it yourself. Using a typesetting program such as InDesign, Quark or TeX you prepare the book yourself, from page numbers to the header, from the font to the design of the cover. This is obviously more difficult and time consuming, since most of us are not professional DTP engineers (?). But the second way is also more geeky and fun, so I think that it is clear what I chose to do.

My tool of choice was LaTeX, which is a tool/platform used mainly for scientific articles about math, physics or CS. It is not really used for really graphical DTP, so some tasks are quite cumbersome, compared to more WYSIWIG app like InDesign. On the other hand, because th form is completely separated from the content, it is much easier to use macros and external scripts to automate certain tasks. I will write more details about it in another post. I did some graphics in Illustrator (cover page), but most of the work was done and written in LaTeX. True geekiness! 

In October I started with the preparations, deciding on layout, orientation etc. I also collected all the articles and converted them to a more LaTeX-friendly format. The most annoying part was conversion and positioning of the images and photos, because in default, LaTeX does not place the images inside the text (does not wrap) but in between paragraphs. After few frustrating moments I realized that bending it like this is really not working well, but I had no other choice. This work went on until mid-December. Few days before coming back to Prague I sent the finished book, including bleed and crop marks, to a print shop in Prague. Few days later they sent me the height of the spine so I adjusted the cover, sent it and then just prayed there won't be any problems. Honestly, I had no idea how it might turn out.

On December 23rd I came back to Prague. In the afternoon, before unpacking my stuff etc. I rushed to the print shop to see the finished book. It was amazing. Everything looked so pretty and neat and fortunately, everything was all right. I made only 6 copies of the book --- two for my parents, one for my sister, two for my friends and one for me --- but I was thinking about making some more in the future. We'll see. Anyway, I also have a PDF version, which I decided to publish on-line. If you are interested in it, download it [here][book].

I will be more than happy if you would comment on it or just tell me that you like it:)
